# blockchain-trace
 
 Blockchain-Trace is a web3 dapp based on covalent apis to easily trace the evm blockchain infos.
 
 The blockchain-trace has the following functions:
 
 1. search the tokens balances for a given user address.
 2. search the all holders for a given contract address.
 3. search the transactions for a given user address and/or a given contract.
 4. search the emit log events for a given contract. (for the hackathon Event-Specific Endpoints).
